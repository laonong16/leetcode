172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.


class Solution {
    /*
    0 is the product of 2 and 5. In n!, we need to know how many 2 and 5, and the number of zeros is the minimum of the number of 2 and the number of 5.

Since multiple of 2 is more than multiple of 5, the number of zeros is dominant by the number of 5.
