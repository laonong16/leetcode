553. Optimal Division
Given a list of positive integers, the adjacent integers will perform the float division. For example, [2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You should find out 
how to add parenthesis to get the maximum result, and return the corresponding expression in string format.
 Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.

Example:
Input: [1000,100,10,2]
Output: "1000/(100/10/2)"
Explanation:
1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/((100/10)/2) = 200
However, the bold parenthesis in "1000/((100/10)/2)" are redundant, 
since they don't influence the operation priority. So you should return "1000/(100/10/2)". 

Other cases:
1000/(100/10)/2 = 50
1000/(100/(10/2)) = 50
1000/100/10/2 = 0.5
1000/100/(10/2) = 2
Note:

The length of the input array is [1, 10].
Elements in the given array will be in range [2, 1000].
There is only one optimal division for each test case.

/*
Using some simple math we can find the easy solution of this problem. Consider the input in the form of [a,b,c,d], 
now we have to set priority of operations to maximize a/b/c/d. We know that to maximize fraction p/qp/q, qq(denominator) should be minimized. 
So, to maximize a/b/c/da/b/c/d we have to first minimize b/c/d. Now our objective turns to minimize the expression b/c/d.

There are two possible combinations of this expression, b/(c/d) and (b/c)/d.

b/(c/d)        (b/c)/d = b/c/d
(b*d)/c        b/(d*c)
d/c            1/(d*c)
Obviously, d/c > 1/(d*c)d/c>1/(dâˆ—c) for d>1d>1.

You can see that second combination will always be less than first one for numbers greater than 11. So, 
the answer will be a/(b/c/d). Similarly for expression like a/b/c/d/e/f... answer will be a/(b/c/d/e/f...).
